=KoC Power Bot - Barb=

==Important Information=
With the release of Kabam's "Barbarian Raid" across all domains, the Barb tab will be removed from the KoC Power Bot. However, the information on the auto-barbing function will remain for a period of time as there are reports of the Raid being disabled on a few select domains and the feature can still be found on previous versions of the Power Bot.

==Getting Started==

<p>Selecting the Barb tab of your Power Bot will bring up the Barbarian Auto Attack function. Barbarian camps are one of the best sources of the important resource food. However, manually attacking barbarian camps for the required food to maintain high might in the game is a tedious process. The Barbarian Auto Attack will send out attacks to camps surrounding your city and gather food for your troops as long as your game is up and running in your browser and the barb function is turned on. </p>
<p><em>*Tip - For fast start-up of the Power Bot barb, all the quick basics are in the help section of the bot.</em></p>
<p><em>(Note - the appearance of the tab bar will change as new features are added to the bot and/or obsolete features are removed.) </em></p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://koc-power-bot.googlecode.com/files/BotBarb1.jpg" width="755" height="422">
<p>When the Power Bot is first loaded, it will search for all barbs coord within search distance of your city. This can take a while, especially if you have chosen a large search distance. The Power Bot will also do a check on refresh to see if any of your city coords have changed. Once the Power Bot has coords to attack, you need to have troops selected and the levels of the barbs to attack for each city before it will send attacks. 
<p><em>*Tip - If your cities are too close, (as in practically on top of one another), you will only need to barb out of one city. It is recommended for maximum food collection that your cities have some distance between them. </em>

<p align="left"><em>*Tip - you may wish to have a further distance for barbing with Cavalry and keep the slower troops closer to your city for faster return in case of attack.</em>
<p align="left"><strong>Options</strong>

<p align="left">You may reset your barbs in this area and veiw barbs that are assigned to a particular city in this area. You may even exclude certain barb coords from attack if you happen to come across a "bad barb" which will kill troops if normal numbers for the barb level are sent on attack.

<p align="left"><strong>Help</strong>

<p>This is the quick help that is found inside of the Barb tab.

<p><strong>Trouble Shooting</strong>

<p>If you find your barb suddenly not working, your first course of action should be to reset.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have the latest update of the KOC Power Bot. </p>
<p>The KOC Power Bot does not conflict with KOCAttack - Extra Features. However, if you have other attack scripts loaded, it is strongly recommended that you uninstall them. </p>
<p>Sometimes an overloaded server on Kabam's part will slow down the barb auto attack as errors from marches increase. Often there is not much that can be done in this instance beyond waiting the issue out.
