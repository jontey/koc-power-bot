                  HOW TO Release a new Power BOT version
                  ======================================

1) Update readme.txt in /trunk: Add a list of fixes/enhancements/etc for the version to be released. 
   This can be copy/pasted to the main pages at userscripts.org and googlecode (below).
   The issues and source/changes lists at googlecode are very useful for this!

2) Make sure the version string in KOCpowerBot.user.js is appropriate (var Version='YYYYMMDDx')
   Change and commit it if needed.

3) Tag the release in SVN : 
      FROM = https://koc-power-bot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
      TO = https://koc-power-bot.googlecode.com/svn/tags/<<VERSION>>-release
      
4) Create a new Download at: http://code.google.com/p/koc-power-bot/downloads/list
   Give it the name of  KOCpowerBot.<<VERSION>>.user.js  
   Indicate in the summary that it is a release
   
5) From The Administor tab, change the "Download KOC Power BOT" link to point to the new download,
   and change the version in the link's description. Add revision history information.
   
6) Change all issues marked as 'Fixed_in_SVN' to 'fixed'   

7) Log in to userscripts.org as DonDavici.
   Go to the Power Bot page .. http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95542
   Upload the new version.
   Edit description with the revision history information.
