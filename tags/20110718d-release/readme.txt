General Development Guidelines:

1. If you are a developer, please make sure to work inside of your /workspaces/{author} folder.

2. When publishing a new version to the /trunk/, be sure to place a previous version of the
   script into the /tags/ folder.

3. Always leave a note when checking in revisions that describes the work that was done.

4. When publishing a new version, be sure to add your revision notes to the /trunk/revisions.txt
   file, and also to the revision log on userscripts.

5. If you have published a new version here on google code, but don't have access to the
   KoCScripters userscripts.org account, simply let the rest of the team know (via the facebook
   group) so that one of the authorized team members knows that they should publish the
   new version publicly.
